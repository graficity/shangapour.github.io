            <br>
          <p>Graffiti in our contemporary cities, has become so popular as an important means for people to express themselves. B usinesses have also benefited from graffiti as a free advertising medium. Whereas it, most of the time, lacks aesthetic appeal or might be considered as a form of vandalism , graffiti remains as the voice and appearance of those whose opinions, sentiments and intelligence have not been heard and seen.</p>
          <p>We believe that technology could make a hybrid space as an innovative opportunity for the self expression of each and everyone in streets while leaving facades and frontages clean and undamaged. Apart from current social networks’ virtual pages, ordinary people equally need to have urban spaces to express themselves as well. Our startup sets out to develop an application that provides citizens, using simple user friendly tools, with an augmented reality (AR) technique for sharing their content over urban frontages. What one virtually writes, draws or paints to share is viewed in the real world through the lens of smart phone cameras and can be commented on and edited. While walking through city areas, people, using our application, can discover, over their phone cameras, a different interesting urban experience reflecting others’ feelings and ways of thinking. Furthermore, businesses of various sizes can enjoy advertising opportunities our application offers.</p>

            <br>
            <p> Using sensors such as accelerometer, GPS, gyroscope, solid state compass, images that have been generated and shared on the application, overlays people’s view of the real urban faces and facades and can be evaluated or even, without being removed, superimposed by new images.</p>

            <p>Our application is unique in its kind, as it engages the social network with real urban spaces through augmented reality . Users can enjoy a deeper understanding of urban inhabitants revealing interesting and informative layers generated by AR.</p></div>
            <div><p>It is the only application that allows any ordinary user produce its own AR images over city facades. AR apps like Wikitude , AR City, CityLab are limited to only internally created AR images.</p></div>
            <div id="large"><p>This application provides a quite just, fair and open space for any ideas and outdoing social networks platform like Facebook, Instagram that favor famous people more, it shows preference for images based on the importance of the urban surface on which the image over lays and the degree of welcome it receives, not only the name of the producer. So it is quite selective in which creativity matters most and the specificity of images that is being matched to a specific location, direction and size means the minimum risk of copying.</p></div>
            <div><p>Compared to other social media advertising platform, It provides an impartial space for small businesses as the visual creativity of their advertisement carries more weight than their financial position.</p></div>
            <div><p>As the activities are location based, it is a new and unique digital social network concept in which local people in any specifi c geographic area get to socialize in streets. Current social networks fail to enable local connections and interactions whereas Graficity can help you know how the people around you feel and think.</p></div>
            <div><p>There is no application at present fully embracing our concept and offering all abovementioned options at once.</p>

As for his research and professional career he has focused on how urban public spaces can contribute to the enhancement of social interactions. Since 2009, he has, in particular, considered on integration of virtual spaces into urban reality, creation of a hybrid memorial space where people can share their memories and feeling on physical urban places. He also carries good knowledge and experience of computer programming and coding (Java, Python, android studio, AR and Unity). Recently, he won ‘Cities for our Future competition’ in UK which is about re-purposing public spaces outside of office hours to provide safe and sustainable homeless accommodation. In 2017, he proposed a disruptive business idea which was accepted as the winner by Danish Business Authority. Now he is working on Graficity. </p>
